		  <h1> ABOUT US</h1>
		  <p> ‘Zen’ refers to a ‘Jiwa’ or soul experiencing a feeling of content and balance amongst the daily hustle. We learned and experienced that living in a fast-paced society isn’t always ‘green’. So was born ZENJIWA. A collective of fragrance line that aims to influence a wellbeing lifestyle by altering your personal space into a zen sanctuary. They hand poured scents that give warmth, freshness and calmness. Inspired by relation between nature, mind, body, heart and soul, we made sure to keep the brand’s inherent simplicity and timeless. With an emotional connection to the art direction, visual identity, packaging and a one-of-a-kind feeling of luxury and exclusivity. </p>
